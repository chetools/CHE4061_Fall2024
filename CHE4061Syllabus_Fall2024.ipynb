        "WHAT IF?  Is a question an engineer should never stop asking.  Any calculation worth doing once in a real engineering situation, is inevitably repeated over and over again for different conditions.  Coding to automate calculations is therefore one of the most valuable engineering skills. We will use Python intensively in this class using Google's Colaboratory Jupyter Notebook environment.  It is highly recommended for you to go through the following free online texts to brush up on your Python skills BEFORE our first class:\n",

        "You will have ~1.5 weeks to complete each of these multipart videos submitted as YouTube playlists that would range from 30 to 90 minutes long.  Do note that because you are presenting on camera and not allowed to look at notes while you present and write the code, it will take MANY attempts to make a video worthy of submission.  Make your first recording attempt no later than the 3rd day after each part of the HW is assigned.  It will be much harder than you think - do not procrastinate.  Your camera angles should provide <u>irrefutable</u> evidence that the work is not merely being copied and read aloud.  Make short practice takes to make sure that you have locked focus/exposure and that handwriting, face, and screen are legible."
